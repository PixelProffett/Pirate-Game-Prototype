# Pirate-Game-Prototype
a game about being a pirate

# How to extract and run the game
First, you will need python installed. 
Then in the terminal, type "pip install pygame" without the speech marks.
then make a folder and call it "game" for example. extract all the zip files into that folder.
Lastly, right click main.py and open with python (the one that has the little space rocket icon next to it)

There you have it. You have successfully installed the game. Press escape at any time in-game to quit.
