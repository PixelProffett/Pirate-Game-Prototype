# Pirate-Game-Prototype
a game about being a pirate

# How to extract and run the game
First, you will need python and pygame installed.
Then make a folder and call it "game" for example. extract all the zip files into that folder. make sure you put all the music files in a folder called "music" without the speech marks.
Lastly, right click main.py and open with python (the one that has the little space rocket icon next to it)

There you have it. You have successfully installed the game. Press escape at any time in-game to quit.
